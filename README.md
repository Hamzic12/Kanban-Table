# Kanban Table

Full-stack Python App using Kivy for GUI and SQLAlchemy for database. The app is a Kanban table for software developers to create and manage up to ten tasks, with the ability to set deadlines. Failure to complete tasks on time results in punishment points, which trigger progressively stricter punishments.
